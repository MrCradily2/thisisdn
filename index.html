    <h1> Introduction</h1><br>
    <p> Hello! I'm Royden, a seventeen year old male student currently pursuing a Diploma in Immersive Media in Ngee Ann
        Polytechnic.</p><br>

    <h2>Work Hard, Play Hard!</h2><br>
    <p>
        I beleive that in life we should give our all and maximise our potential, never giving up in the face of
        adversity.
        Ignition of creaivity and innovation should come first when trying to solve problems. We should always be aiming
        for excellence
        and have a strong desire for learning as we grow and develop ourselves. Having a sense of respect for not only
        ourselves, but others too
        is crucial as it is my opinion that it shows what a person is truly like when they treat others with the same
        respect as they would themselves.
        Always being gracious and having a strong sense of integrity are also values I strongly believe in.

    <h2>A True Gamer</h2><br>
    <p>
        Gaming has always been a commanding force in my life, from my first experience with the Pok√©mon games, to games
        such as xenoblade chronices.
        I have always been in love with the way the game designers we able to create such unique maps and level designs.
        I especially love the sound and music design in those games.
        I personally feel that the sound design of a game is one of the ways that a game can differenciate itself from
        other similar games.
        My passion for games has been ignited and i hope that one day i will design a game that i can be proud of.

    <h2>A Man and His Guitar</h2>
    <p>
        i have played the Guitar since the age of 9 and have been in love with music ever since. I listen to many genres of music 
        from the more popular pop songs of today, to the old classics from the 1960s and even progressive rock bands. 
        This passion of mine has had a resounding effect on my life, as i have spent many hours on my guitars learning how to play songs.
        I especially love game music as i feel that they are themed well.
    </p>
