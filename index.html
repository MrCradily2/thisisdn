                <p> Hello! I'm Royden, a seventeen year old male student currently pursuing a Diploma in Immersive Media

                    <h2>Work Hard, Play Hard!</h2><br>
                    <p>
                        I beleive that in life we should give our all and maximise our potential, never giving up in the
                        face of
                        adversity.
                        Ignition of creaivity and innovation should come first when trying to solve problems. We should
                        always
                        be
                        aiming
                        for excellence
                        and have a strong desire for learning as we grow and develop ourselves. Having a sense of
                        respect
                        for
                        not
                        only
                        ourselves, but others too
                        is crucial as it is my opinion that it shows what a person is truly like when they treat others
                        with
                        the
                        same
                        respect as they would themselves.
                        Always being gracious and having a strong sense of integrity are also values I strongly believe
                        in.

                    <h2>A True Gamer</h2><br>
                    <p>
                        Gaming has always been a commanding force in my life, from my first experience with the Pok√©mon
                        games,
                        to
                        games
                        such as xenoblade chronices.
                        I have always been in love with the way the game designers we able to create such unique maps
                        and
                        level
                        designs.
                        I especially love the sound and music design in those games.
                        I personally feel that the sound design of a game is one of the ways that a game can
                        differenciate
                        itself
                        from
                        other similar games.
                        My passion for games has been ignited and i hope that one day i will design a game that i can be
                        proud
                        of.

                    <h2>Influence of Music</h2>
                    <p>
                        i have played the Guitar since the age of 9 and have been in love with music ever since. I
                        listen to
                        many
                        genres of music
                        from the more popular pop songs of today, to the old classics from the 1960s and even
                        progressive
                        rock
                        bands.
                        This passion of mine has had a resounding effect on my life, as i have spent many hours on my
                        guitars
                        learning how to play songs.
                        I especially love game music as i feel that they are themed well.
