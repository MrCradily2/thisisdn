## Royden's Amazing Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website for me. I have included some pictures of me, a little about me and some ways contact.

## Design Process

i decided to make a relatively simpler website. This website is for employers who want to know more aobut me to have a space to contact me. 
This website shows some of the things i enjoy doing and some of my inspirations.

## Features

There is a navbar that scrolls with the page. The scroll is also smooth and this allows people to locate what they want to know about me

### Existing Features
navbar - allows users to easily navigate the page

### Features Left to Implement

want to add a floating arrow pointing down that encourages uses to scroll down

## Technologies Used
